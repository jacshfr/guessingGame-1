guessingGame
============

The guessing game for Codefellows Foundations Bootcamp day 1.

I decided to do the classic "guess a number between 1 and 100" guessing game. The game allows 7 guesses for the user, and notifies the user if their guess is too high or too low. The game ends when the user either guesses correctly or runs out of guesses before they answer correctly. The user is notified of the outcome, and the program ends.
